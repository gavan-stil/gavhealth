## Backlog (top priority first)

1. Sleep dashboard — stage bars, consistency %, debt tracker (ref: `archive/gavhealth[original-design].html`)
3. Goal rings — 4 SVG rings (Sleep, Activity, Nutrition, Recovery) as dashboard hero
4. Visual polish pass — card textures, micro-animations, Strava-style tabs
5. PWA manifest — `manifest.json` + service worker (install as home screen app)
6. Withings OAuth completion — user action required; sync currently pulls no new data

## Quick Ref

| | |
|--|--|
| Frontend | `gavhealth.vercel.app` (Vercel) |
| Backend | `gavhealth-production.up.railway.app` (Railway FastAPI) |
| Git | `github.com/gavan-stil/gavhealth` (branch: main) |
| API auth | `X-API-Key` header — value in `.env` as `VITE_API_KEY` |
| Gate password | `VITE_GATE_PASSWORD` env var |

**All API calls:** `apiFetch` from `src/lib/api.ts` — never raw `fetch`

**Design tokens:** `src/styles/tokens.css` — always use `--var` names, never raw values
