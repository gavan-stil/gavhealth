Started: 2026-03-16

## Protocol (per bug)
1. FIND — read code, trace data flow, curl-verify endpoint
2. DOCUMENT — write here immediately
3. FIX — one bug, one edit, npm run build passes
4. SPEC CHECK — update reference/api.md, architecture.md, or MEMORY if not covered
5. MARK — tick off, move on

## Bug Severity Scale
- **Critical** — data corruption, silent wrong values persisted to DB
- **High** — feature broken, data silently dropped, crash
- **Medium** — wrong value displayed, edge case silent failure

### BUG-001 [High] — `save_strength_log` auto-link can claim already-linked activities
- **File:** `backend/app/routers/new_endpoints.py:316–333`
- **Layer:** Backend — session linking
- **Description:** When saving a manual strength log via `/api/log/strength/save`, the auto-link query matches any `workout` activity on the same date without checking if that activity is already linked to another session. This allows two sessions to claim the same `activity_log_id`.
- **Compare:** `confirm_strength_entry` (logging.py:162–177) correctly has `AND id NOT IN (SELECT activity_log_id FROM strength_sessions WHERE activity_log_id IS NOT NULL)`.
- **Repro:** Log two strength sessions on the same date back-to-back via the manual save flow. Both will claim the same workout activity.
- **Risk:** Duplicate session–workout links. The `link_strength_session` endpoint guards against this (409), but `save_strength_log` bypasses the guard entirely.

---

### BUG-002 [High] — `PATCH /api/log/strength/{id}/relink` doesn't update the bridged strength_session
- **File:** `backend/app/routers/new_endpoints.py:595–610`
- **Layer:** Backend — session linking
- **Description:** The relink endpoint only updates `manual_strength_logs.matched_activity_id`. It does NOT update `strength_sessions.activity_log_id` for the bridged session. The feed and trends query `strength_sessions.activity_log_id` — so the visual link shown in the feed is unaffected by a relink call.
- **Compare:** The `unlink` endpoint at line 644–665 correctly updates BOTH tables. Relink only updates one.
- **Repro:** Tap "Relink" on a strength log → assign a different activity → feed still shows old link (or no link).
- **Risk:** Relinking a manual strength log appears to do nothing in the UI.

---

### BUG-003 [High] — `DELETE /api/activity-logs/{id}` leaves dangling `strength_sessions.activity_log_id`
- **File:** `backend/app/routers/new_endpoints.py:1470–1479`
- **Layer:** Backend — data integrity
- **Description:** Deleting an activity_log does not NULL out `strength_sessions.activity_log_id` for any sessions pointing to it. No FK constraint exists on this column (model is `Integer, nullable=True` without ForeignKey). After deletion, the session has a stale `activity_log_id` pointing to a non-existent row.
- **Effect:** `GET /api/strength/sessions` LEFT JOINs activity_logs — for deleted activities the join returns NULL columns but the session still shows `activity_log_id != null`, so it doesn't appear as orphaned in the feed.
- **Repro:** Delete a workout in the feed → the linked strength session now shows as "linked" with no matching activity.
- **Risk:** Ghost links that can't be resolved without manual DB cleanup.

---

### BUG-004 [Medium] — Workout split edit doesn't update linked strength session label
- **File:** `src/components/ActivityEditSheet.tsx:373–384` + `backend/app/routers/new_endpoints.py:1440–1467`
- **Layer:** Frontend + Backend — workout edit
- **Description:** When editing a "workout" type activity in ActivityEditSheet, saving `workout_split` writes to `activity_logs.workout_split` column. But `GET /api/activities/feed` doesn't return this column, and the feed's split label display reads `strength_sessions.session_label` (from `linkedByActivityId[item.id].session_label`). Editing the split via ActivityEditSheet is effectively a no-op — the display doesn't change.
- **Also:** `GET /api/activity` (data.py:246) derives `workout_split` from `ss.session_label AS workout_split` via JOIN, not from `activity_logs.workout_split`. So the stored column is never surfaced.
- **Repro:** Edit a workout → change split from "push" to "pull" → save → feed still shows "push".
- **Risk:** Confusing UX — save appears to work (no error) but nothing changes.

### BUG-005 [Medium] — `update_strength_session` duration update silently fails for NLP-confirmed sessions
- **File:** `backend/app/routers/new_endpoints.py:1003–1007`
- **Layer:** Backend — session update
- **Description:** `PATCH /api/strength/sessions/{id}` updates duration via `UPDATE manual_strength_logs SET duration_minutes = :dur WHERE bridged_session_id = :id`. Sessions created via the NLP confirm flow (`/api/log/strength/confirm`) have no `manual_strength_logs` row — the UPDATE affects 0 rows silently and returns `{"ok": True}`.
- **Repro:** Create a session via NLP confirm → open edit sheet → change duration → save → duration unchanged.
- **Risk:** Silent failure on a user action that appears to succeed.

---

### BUG-006 [Medium] — `list_strength_sessions` and `last_strength_log` show wrong date (logged date, not workout date)
- **File:** `backend/app/routers/new_endpoints.py:675, 413`
- **Layer:** Backend — data display
- **Description:** Both endpoints use `created_at::date` as the session date. If you log a session for yesterday's workout today, the date shown is today. Should use `COALESCE(start_time AT TIME ZONE 'Australia/Brisbane'::date, created_at AT TIME ZONE 'Australia/Brisbane'::date)`.
- **Repro:** Log a workout with `start_time` set to yesterday → date in feed shows today.
- **Risk:** Session history dates are off when logging is done retroactively.

---

### BUG-007 [Low] — `OrphanCard` passes unsupported query params to `/api/strength/sessions`
- **File:** `src/components/log/ActivityFeed.tsx:589`
- **Layer:** Frontend — orphan detail fetch
- **Description:** Fetches `/api/strength/sessions?start_date=X&end_date=Y&limit=20`. The endpoint only supports `?days=N` — unknown params are silently ignored. Returns all sessions in the default 90-day window instead of filtered results. Works via ID fallback (`withEx.find(s => s.id === session.id)`), but fetches unnecessary data and will miss sessions older than 90 days.
- **Risk:** Low — works but wasteful; edge case miss for old sessions.

---

### BUG-008 [Low] — `EffortBadge` ignores `isUnreviewed` prop
- **File:** `src/components/log/ActivityFeed.tsx:816`
- **Layer:** Frontend — UI
- **Description:** Component signature declares `isUnreviewed: boolean` but the prop is not destructured or used in the render. Unreviewed activities show the same icon as manually reviewed ones — no visual differentiation.
- **Risk:** Low — UX polish only. The prop is passed at line 408 but does nothing.

---

### BUG-009 [Low] — `useIntradayHR` timezone workaround is fragile
- **File:** `src/hooks/useIntradayHR.ts:27–30`
- **Layer:** Frontend — hook
- **Description:** Uses `now.setTime(now.getTime() + 10 * 3600 * 1000); now.toISOString().split("T")[0]` to get Brisbane date. This is technically correct but is the exact fragile pattern flagged in MEMORY — if this were copy-pasted it would fail. The approved pattern is `new Date().toLocaleDateString('en-CA')` (using device locale). However since device is in Brisbane this still gives the right result, so impact is nil.
- **Risk:** Nil currently — purely a code quality issue.

---

### LOG-001 [High] — ActivityDetailSheet uses wrong edit type for workout items
- **File:** `src/components/log/ActivityDetailSheet.tsx:754`
- **Layer:** Frontend — activity feed edit
- **Description:** The edit sheet always opens with `type={'activity'}`, which renders the run/ride form (distance, pace, HR fields) for all item types. Workout and strength items should open `type='workout'` to get the split picker, date/time, and duration fields. Currently editing a workout from the feed shows distance/pace inputs instead of the split picker, and saves to the wrong columns.
- **Repro:** Activity feed → tap a Workout card → tap pencil icon → see Distance/Pace fields instead of Split/Date fields.
- **Risk:** High — workout edits from the feed are silently no-ops (wrong fields saved).

---

### LOG-002 [Medium] — ActivityDetailSheet uses `deriveSplit()` instead of `session_label`
- **File:** `src/components/log/ActivityDetailSheet.tsx:268`
- **Layer:** Frontend — feed session detail
- **Description:** Split label in the linked session panel uses `deriveSplit(raw.exercises)` — ignores `linkedSession.session_label`. Same pattern as CAL-001 (fixed in DayDetailSheet). Abs sessions show "Session". Sessions with no exercise category strings show wrong splits.
- **Compare:** `DayDetailSheet.tsx` was fixed (CAL-001) to prefer `session_label`. `ActivityDetailSheet` was missed.
- **Risk:** Medium — wrong split display in the activity feed detail sheet.

## Resolved

### ~~LOG-001~~ [High] — ActivityDetailSheet wrong edit type for workouts ✅ Fixed (2026-03-16, commit: 7147ba7)
Workout/strength items now open `type='workout'` with `WorkoutInit` (split picker, date/time, HR fields). Run/ride items continue to use `type='activity'`. `workout_split` sourced from `linkedSession.session_label`.

### ~~LOG-002~~ [Medium] — ActivityDetailSheet deriveSplit vs session_label ✅ Fixed (2026-03-16, commit: 7147ba7)
Split display now uses `session_label` (capitalised) first, falls back to `deriveSplit()`. Mirrors the CAL-001 fix already applied to `DayDetailSheet`.

### ~~BUG-003~~ [High] — Delete activity leaves dangling session link ✅ Fixed (2026-03-16, commit: e824f3e)
`DELETE /api/activity-logs/{id}` now NULLs `strength_sessions.activity_log_id` before deleting.

### ~~BUG-002~~ [High] — Relink doesn't update strength_session ✅ Fixed (2026-03-16, commit: e824f3e)
`PATCH /api/log/strength/{id}/relink` now updates `strength_sessions.activity_log_id` via `bridged_session_id`.

### ~~BUG-004~~ [Medium] — Workout split edit is a no-op ✅ Fixed (2026-03-16, commit: e824f3e)
`PATCH /api/activity-logs/{id}` propagates `workout_split` → `strength_sessions.session_label`. DB column missing fix was already in previous session.

### ~~BUG-005~~ [Medium] — Duration update silent fail for NLP sessions ✅ Fixed (2026-03-16, commit: e824f3e)
Duration edit also updates `activity_logs.duration_mins` for sessions without a `manual_strength_logs` row.

### ~~BUG-006~~ [Medium] — Wrong date in session list ✅ Fixed (2026-03-16, commit: e824f3e)
`list_strength_sessions` + `last_strength_log` now cast dates with `AT TIME ZONE 'Australia/Brisbane'`.

### ~~BUG-001~~ [High] — Duplicate auto-link in `save_strength_log` ✅ Fixed (other session, 2026-03-16)
Added exclusivity check (mirrors `confirm_strength_entry`). Manual link endpoint also now returns 409 on conflict.

### ~~BUG-004 (partial)~~ [Medium] — workout_split column missing from DB ✅ Fixed (other session, 2026-03-16)
Column migration added to `main.py` startup. PATCH `/api/activity-logs/{id}` no longer errors on `workout_split`. The split label vs `activity_logs.workout_split` display mismatch (feed reads from `session_label` not column) remains as BUG-004 above.

### ~~(new fix)~~ — DayDetailSheet missing Edit/Link buttons for unlinked sessions ✅ Fixed (other session, 2026-03-16)
Calendar day detail now shows "Edit session" (set split label) and "Link workout" for unlinked strength sessions.
